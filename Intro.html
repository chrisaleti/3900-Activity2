I was born in Hyderabad, India but have been living in Omaha since 2008. I received my Bachelors from Creighton University. Some of my hobbies include playing and watching sports such as soccer, cricket. I also really enjoy traveling and have travelled to four countries so far and hoping to add more to the list.
